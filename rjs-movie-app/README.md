# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# react
React is a front-end js library for building user-interfaces. 
- Developed by Facebook
- Has cross platform support

# React JS is a component-based front-end library
- all parts of the web app are divided into small components



# component 
- small piece of the UI
- every react app is a tree of components
- components let you split the UI into independent, resuable  parts
These components are then combined to create a fully fledged web application

# In this project we are going to create a web application that contains movies with their ratings
- this webpage will contain a searchbar(header), sidebar, movies and movie component within movies for each individual movie component within the movies component

# Types of components - 2 types: Functional & Class-based
Class components
- import react 
- create the class and let it extend component from react
- use a render method and add some html in it to display content

Functional components 
- import react 
- create a function, a normal one or an arrow function and there goes your class



# JSX 
- Used in React to describe what the UI should look like
- Produces react elements



# Setting up the React environment
- use: npm create-react-app gym-app
